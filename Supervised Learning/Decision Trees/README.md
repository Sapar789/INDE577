# Decision Trees for Texas Weather Classification

![Decision Tree Example](/imgs/decision_tree.png)

This section demonstrates the implementation of Decision Trees for classifying weather conditions in Texas, specifically focusing on identifying stormy weather patterns. The goal is to understand which weather features are most important for predicting storm conditions.

## Overview
Decision Trees are powerful classification algorithms that make predictions by learning simple decision rules from the data features. In this implementation, we use Decision Trees to classify weather conditions and identify the most important meteorological features that contribute to storm formation.

**Decision Trees** are a popular supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They model decisions and their possible consequences as a tree-like structure composed of nodes and branches. Each internal node represents a decision based on a feature (usually using a threshold or categorical value), each branch represents the outcome of the decision, and each leaf node represents a final output or class label.

The construction of a decision tree involves selecting the best features to split the data at each step. This is typically done using criteria such as **Gini Impurity**, **Entropy** (used in Information Gain), or **Mean Squared Error** (for regression tasks). The goal is to create pure subsets where data points within a node mostly belong to the same class.

Decision Trees are **easy to understand and interpret**, even for non-experts, and they do not require feature scaling or normalization. However, they can be prone to **overfitting**, especially if the tree grows too deep and captures noise in the training data. To address this, techniques such as **pruning**, **setting maximum depth**, or using ensemble methods like **Random Forests** are commonly applied.

Overall, decision trees provide a powerful and intuitive framework for decision-making, particularly when interpretability is important. However, they may not perform as well as other models on complex datasets without proper tuning and regularization.
