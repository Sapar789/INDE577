## **Overview**  

This notebook shows how to create a **custom Random Forest model** in order to categorize rainfall using the Texas Weather dataset for the purpose of learning.  Understanding how decision trees function separately and how Random Forests integrate them to create a potent ensemble classifier is the aim.  Additionally, it contains **feature distribution**, **confusion matrix analysis** and **model implementation**.

---

## **Objectives**  

- Comprehend the basic concept of Random Forest.
- Peform data exploration and visualization
- Explore feature relationships with Random Forest model
- Build Random Forest Model for for Rainfall prediction

---

## **Tools & Libraries**  


- `pandas` â€“ for data loading and manipulation  
- `numpy` â€“ for mathematical operations  
- `collections.Counter` â€“ for majority voting in ensemble predictions  
- `sklearn.model_selection` â€“ for splitting data into train/test  
-  `matplotlib` and  `seaborn` â€“ for additional visualizations  

---

## **Sample Visuals**  


- Histogram to analyze precipitation data distribution 
- Boxplot humidity and preciptation relationship and to check for outliers. 
- Confusion matrix to analyze predictions
