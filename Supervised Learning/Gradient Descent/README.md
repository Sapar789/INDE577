## **Overview**  

This notebook demonstrates how to create a **Gradient Descent-based model** to predict **solar radiation** using the Texas weather data. The focus is on understanding data exploration for the task and the **mathematical principles behind gradient descent**, implementing it, and analyzing weather feature relationships to build an interpretable and effective model.

## **Objectives**  

- Comprehend the basic concept of Gradient Descent.
- Peform data exploration and visualization
- Build  Gradient Descent model to predict Solar Radiation

---

## **Tools & Libraries**  

- `pandas` â€“ for data loading and preprocessing  
- `numpy` â€“ for mathematical operations and vectorized computations  
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` â€“ for visualization

## **Sample Visuals**  

- Correlation heatmap to select the most relevant features  
- Histogram of solar radiation to visualize target distribution  
- Scatter plot of **humidity vs. solar radiation** to detect patterns  
- Training **loss curve** over epochs to visualize model convergence
