Using Texas Weather data, this notebook shows how to use **Logistic Regression** to varying types of logistic regressions and to try out probability estimation.  Gaining a thorough grasp of how logistic regression can be used to address various supervised learning issues, with an emphasis on binary and multinomial classification and probability estimation, is the aim.



## **Overview**
_____

**Logistic Regression** is a widely used statistical method for analyzing datasets in which the outcome variable is categorical. It is part of the family of generalized linear models and is particularly useful for classification problems. Despite its name, logistic regression is primarily used for classification, not regression.

In this notebook, we explore three core applications of logistic regression:

- **Binary Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification problems where the outcome variable has two classes.
- **Multinomial Logistic Regression**: An extension used for multiclass classification tasks where the target variable has more than two categories.
- **Probability Estimation**: Logistic regression models the probability of a sample belonging to a particular class, enabling interpretable, calibrated confidence in predictions.

Logistic regression works by modeling the **log-odds** of the target variable as a linear combination of the input features. The predicted values are passed through a **sigmoid function** to map the outputs to a range between 0 and 1, representing probabilities.

This notebook covers both the usage of **custom implementation of logistic regression** built from scratch using Python and NumPy to deepen understanding of the underlying math and training dynamics.



## **Weather Data Features**
---

The dataset used includes meteorological variables commonly used in weather forecasting:

- Maximum and minimum temperature  
- Humidity  
- Wind speed  
- Precipitation  
- Atmospheric pressure  
- Solar radiation  

These features are used to model and predict outcomes such as whether it will rain tomorrow, or to classify days into weather categories
