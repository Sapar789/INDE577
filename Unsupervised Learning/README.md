Unsupervised learning is a machine learning algorithm used to find patterns, relationships, or groupings in data **without using labeled outputs**. Unlike supervised learning—where models learn from known labels—unsupervised algorithms must **discover structure** in the data on their own.

When there are no established categories or when we want to examine the data to uncover hidden patterns, this learning approach is helpful. Typical methods include dimensionality reduction, which preserves the most useful features while lowering complexity, and clustering, which groups related data points.

Unsupervised learning is essential for preprocessing, anomaly detection, recommendation systems, and exploratory data analysis because the majority of real-world data is labelless.



## **Topic: K-Means Clustering**

This project applies **K-Means Clustering**, a core unsupervised learning algorithm, to a **Texas weather dataset** in order to identify groups of days with similar weather characteristics.
